* Independent Conditional VAE (ICVAE)
- Paper: [[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8706960][Adaptive augmentation of medical data using independently conditional variational auto-encoders]]

# A simple convolutional version of the model has been trained on CelebA dataset, to learn appearance features of celebrities with and without hats.

# The model can add/remove hat to the photo.

# | Original (with hat)    | Hat removed      |
# | [[./orig_hat.png]]         | [[./remove_hat.png]] |
# |------------------------+------------------|
# | Original (without hat) | Hat added        |
# | [[./orig_no_hat.png]]      | [[./add_hat.png]]    |

- Traverse of the latent space with different labels when trained on [[https://github.com/deepmind/dsprites-dataset][dSprite dataset]] with latent size 16 (first 16) and label size 4 (last 4):

# - The results can be potentially imroved via state-of-the-art decoders.
